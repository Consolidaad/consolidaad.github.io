The thing I like the most is to build stuff. Stuff that can be used to solve some sort of problem within an operation.
Starting as a developer would be an obvious choice for me to start my career with. One might say. However, developing is
just one aspect. Another cool aspect is to have to design stuff. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s not the job a developer is
expected to do.
